# Flara: E-Commerce for Learning Hacks

_Spark your learning flare with FLARA. This is a personal hackathon._

Plan of attack: build a basic functioning e-commerce website.

Total hours put into the project: x hours.

## Motivation

I built a barebone e-commerce website called [DevBites](http://devbites.herokuapp.com/ 'DevBites Website') during my time as a
web development student at Fullstack Academy. However, the given timeline of
5 days, along with new concepts to juggle as a team such as Agile team workflow,
proper team Git workflow, new database design patterns, and authentication
strategies, the project was completed in haste.

As a result, in order to better cement the lessons I learned from that
experience, I decided to recreate it with additional learning objectives
in mind.

## Goals

0. Implementing basic e-commerce features from DevBites
1. Implementing a data normalized Redux store
1. Implementing pagination for product list display
1. Implementing persistent guest cart for non-authenticated users
1. Implementing guest cart merge with user cart post-signup
1. Implementing route protection and user validation
1. Implementing admin page for administrative control
1. Implementing dummy payment system with dummy cash
1. Implementing OAuth with Google and/or Github
1. Implementing email confirmation for order checkout
1. Implementing loading state for UI
1. Implementing toast notifications for user events
